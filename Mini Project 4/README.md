# ðŸŽ“ Mini-Project: University Management System

This C console program simulates a basic university management system, allowing administrators to manage student registrations, courses, and information retrieval.

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

In a university, managing student and course information is essential.  
This mini-application implements fundamental C programming concepts, including:

- **Structures (`struct`)** to model students and courses  
- **Static arrays** to store data  
- **Functions** to organize code and avoid repetition  
- **Conditions and loops** to manage program logic

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal is to provide a simple solution that allows the university administrator (program user) to:

1. Add students with personal information (ID, first name, last name, age, average grade).  
2. Add courses with details (code, name, credits, grade).  
3. Display the list of registered students.  
4. Display the list of available courses.  
5. Search for a student by ID (**Bonus**).  
6. Modify the grade of an existing course (**Bonus**).

## ðŸ’¡ Tips & Notes  
- Run **Borland C** in compatibility mode if needed.  
- Keep file paths simple to avoid compile errors.  
- **uni(.h):** This project include a header file (`.h`). Make sure to include it in your editor or IDE so the compiler can locate it correctly.
